		<p> I am a researcher scientist in the Autonomous and Smart Systems Unit at <a href="http://tekniker.es"> Tekniker</a>, located in Eibar, Basque Country. Currently I am a Ph.D researcher on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.
<!--  		I also had a brief stint at Latent Logic (acquired by <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a>), a self-driving car startup in Oxford -->
		<p> My research work mainly focuses on applying Artificial Intelligence methods such as deep reinforcement learning (RL) or deep learning (DL), both in computer vision and robotics applications.
